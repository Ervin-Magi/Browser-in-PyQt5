# Browser
My Browser is a simple web browser created using Python and the PyQt5 library. It is designed to demonstrate the basics of creating a web browser using Python.

## Features
Basic web browsing functionality using the QWebEngineView widget
Back button to go back to the previous web page
Forward button to go forward to the next web page
Reload button to reload the current web page

## Requirements
Python 3.x
PyQt5
Usage

The browser will open with the Google website loaded by default. You can navigate to other websites by entering the URL in the address bar or by clicking on links within the website.

## Limitations
This is a basic example of creating a browser with minimal functionality, it should not be used as a fully-featured browser.
This browser is not cross-platform, it will only run on Windows, Linux, and Mac if pyqt5 is installed on the machine.
It doesn't have the functionality to handle private browsing, bookmarks and other features found in modern browsers.
